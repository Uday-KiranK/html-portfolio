<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Hi there! I'm K Uday Kiran, a 19-year-old student currently pursuing my studies at IIIT Dharwad. Hailing from the beautiful state of Andhra Pradesh, I bring a mix of curiosity, creativity, and dedication to everything I do.</p>

<p><h3>Who Am I?</h3><hr/>I’m a tech enthusiast with a passion for Web Development, Animation, and Gaming. 
  Whether it’s building user-friendly websites, exploring the art of storytelling through animation, or diving 
  into immersive gaming experiences, I’m always eager to learn, create, and innovate.<h3>What Drives Me?</h3><hr/>My journey is fueled by the excitement of turning ideas into reality. 
  Web development allows me to shape digital experiences, while animation gives me the freedom to express creativity and imagination. Gaming, on the other hand, is both a passion and a 
  source of inspiration—it challenges me to think critically, strategize, and appreciate intricate designs.<h3>What's Next</h3><hr/>As I continue my studies at IIIT Dharwad, I’m focused 
  on honing my skills in these areas and pushing my creative and technical boundaries. My goal is to not just build websites or animations but to craft experiences that leave a lasting impact.
  Thank you for taking the time to visit my page! Feel free to connect with me if you’d like to collaborate, share ideas, or just chat about tech, animation, or gaming.
